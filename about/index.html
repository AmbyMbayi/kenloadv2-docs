<h4 id="hsmwim-weighing-procedure">HSMWIM Weighing Procedure</h4>
<p>When a vehicle approaches the,</p>
<ul>
<li>HSWIM system picks the number plate </li>
<li>Picks date and time</li>
<li>Gets the road location and lane</li>
<li>Gets the vehicle speed</li>
<li>Gets the vehicle length and distance between the axles</li>
<li>Gets the number of axles</li>
<li>Get the number of tire(s) the vehicle has</li>
<li>Gets the vehicle weight per axle and also Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).</li>
<li>Gets the vehicle classification and computes against the permissible weight.</li>
<li>Sends the results on the Variable Messaging Service (VMS) where the driver can see and know where the vehicle has been directed to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system will be integrated and stores the information for cross reference if the vehicle was called in and weighed on the static weighbridge.</p>
<h4 id="weighing-procedurestaticlsmwimsaw">Weighing Procedure(static/LSMWIM/SAW)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The vehicles approach the weighbridge. The Computer Operator Weighing (COW) checks and confirms the weighbridge is operational and working fine. Confirms the indicator that gets weight on the display shows zero (0) KG. Also confirms that the weighbridge is kept clean and no debris is blocking the weighbridge. </li>
<li>The COW will use the KENLOAD system to weigh the vehicle. The user sign in into Kenload and opens the weighing screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="image info" src="../pictures/login.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The Computer Operator on the Kenload system on the weighing module will click on Weigh button the boom open and the traffic lights will turn green. </li>
<li>
<p>The vehicle enters the Multi Decks weighbridge or the axle the image will be taken and ANPR assist will get the vehicle number plate. Then the boom closes once the vehicle has passed the boom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the vehicle enter the weighbridge Kenload System picks the number plate using automatic number plate recognition and waits the operator to position the vehicles. Then the COW clicks next to show the weight value on the screen. Also shows on the remote displays outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vehicle has a permit the COW request for the permit number and enter which checks with the KeNHA servers and verifies the permit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The computer operator enters the other details trailer number, driver name, vehicle make, cargo, axle type, Transporter, origin, destination and any comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COW takes the weight and advices the vehicle to proceed If the vehicle on the road or if the vehicle is overload or To redistribute or tagged the COW instructs the driver for a delivery note or driver license or a legal document that they can hold to until the vehicle weight is corrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vehicle proceeds to the yard. If it is to redistribute then the prosecutor raise Impounded and Prohibited order and also raise Conditional Load Correction to allow the vehicle to start. Below are sample document</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="presecution-procedure">Presecution Procedure</h4>
<p>The Computer Operator prosecutor (COP) will view list of all the overloaded vehicles. They will be able to select a vehicle to prosecute or prosecute any other vehicles that are not weighed in the system.
The prosecutor enters details of the owner, driver, transporter, location details, court details, Prohibition details.
The prosecutor then generates the relevant document for the specific overload. The various documents are prohibition order, Conditional Load Correction Memo, Charge Sheet and Load Correction Memo.</p>
<h4 id="vehicle-inspector-procedure">Vehicle Inspector Procedure</h4>
<p>The vehicle inspector inspects the wide load vehicle at the station and takes various details of the vehicle. The inspector ensures that the vehicle is also in good condition. </p>
<p>The system will allow the inspector to enter the vehicle details to reject and charge the vehicle owner and/or driver if the vehicle is not in accordance with the permit issued.</p>
<p>All the records will be stored in the system </p>
<h4 id="clerk-census-procedure">Clerk Census Procedure</h4>
<p>The clerk census module will assist the clerk census who is counting the vehicle using the road by assisting in the input of the data they have collected and saving it into the system.
After they have collected the data the input the details in the system specifying the hour, direction or route, vehicle size and type</p>
<h4 id="duty-manager-procedure">Duty Manager Procedure</h4>
<p>The duty manager will be able to use most modules in the system to enable them manage the weighbridge. The specific modules used will be the yard monitoring, special release, overloaded vehicle, called in vehicles and get various notification.
The duty manage will be able to generate reports from the system</p>
